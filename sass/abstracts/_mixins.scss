/**
    When we use the float layout, it will force the elements to have 0 height. This is not a desirable behavior. This is because it will also not take into consideration the specified margins.

    clearfix will attempt to fix this issue. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_clearfix.asp

    TLDR -> Clear fix will append a pseudo element. This pseudo element will then clear the floats. This workaround will then respect the margins specified
